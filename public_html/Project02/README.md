Hello, Welcome to Simran's 1XA3 Project02


Part 1 - Making a CV/Resume webpage:

I have my designed my webpage in two parts, left and right. The left side has my name, contact details as well as the about me section. If you move the mouse towards the left,
the left side will zoom in. Clicking on the Twitter, Facebook, Gmail and/or LinkedIn icon(s) will take you to my social media account or emailing page respectively.
When you click the "Click Here" button in the about me section, it will start displaying a brief introduction about me. Furthermore, when you move
the mouse towards the right, the webpage is zoomed to my resume where you can read my resume. The sections I have added in my resume are Highlights of Qualification,
Experience, Education, Skills and Extra Curricular Activities. Making this webpage was an amazing experience which has made me more confident with coding and it
significantly helped me enhance my coding and problem solving skills. I'm thankful to have this opportunity.

The references I used to design my webpage are as follows:

Part 4 - Server Setup:

For part 4, I copied the project 2 directory to the public_html directory.
Then I added the path of the webpagecv.html file such that the 
link to my webpagecv.html page is 
https://mac1xa3.ca/u/kumars35/Project02/webpagecv.html 
This webpagecv page could be dirrected from the "Project02: CV/Resume Webpage" 
link on my main page https://mac1xa3.ca/u/kumars35/

Thank you for looking at my 1XA3 Project02.
