Hello, Welcome to Simran's 1XA3 Project02

Part 1 - Making a CV/Resume webpage:

I have my designed my webpage in two parts, left and right. The left side has my name, contact details as well as the about me section. If you move the mouse towards the left,
the left side will zoom in. Clicking on the Twitter, Facebook, Gmail and/or LinkedIn icon(s) will take you to my social media account or emailing page respectively.
When you click the "Click Here" button in the about me section, it will start displaying a brief introduction about me. Furthermore, when you move
the mouse towards the right, the webpage is zoomed to my resume where you can read my resume. The sections I have added in my resume are Highlights of Qualification,
Experience, Education, Skills and Extra Curricular Activities. Making this webpage was an amazing experience which has made me more confident with coding and it
significantly helped me enhance my coding and problem solving skills. I'm thankful to have this opportunity.

The references I used to design my webpage are as follows:

Part 3 - Simple Web App:

Hangman Game App

I made a Hangman game app for this part. I used JavaScript and coded the app such that the variables and function names make it easier to understand my code. 
I have a homepage in which the user can enter their username. Then it procedes to the game. My game takes inputs from the keyboard where the user can guess the word 
letter by letter. There is a hint for the word available on the top right side from which the user can get a hint by hovering over the hint box (around the hint word
not on the hint word due to the feature I added). The hint is as to what kind of word it is like an animal, a verb, etc. respectively. 
I used a list to store the words and a seperate list to store the hints (hints: what the type of words are). The maximum limit of incorrect guesses is 9. The guesses 
remaining as well as the alphabets guessed are displayed on the screen simultaneously. Each time the user enters a wrong input, a part of the Hangman drawing image is displayed. 
The 9th wrong input is when the Hangman is hanged due to which the game is over and the correct word is displayed. The user can see their score once the game round is over. 
The user can press any key (except the backspace key) to start another round of the Hangman game. 
Note: the backspace button is used to go back one page.

The references I used for coding my app are:

I hope you liked the app as much as I liked coding it. 

Part 4 - Server Setup:

For part 4, I deleted my old code in index.html and added my Resume/CV page code in the index.html file such that it can be seen on my webpage https://mac1xa3.ca/u/kumars35/ . 
Furthermore, I added my part 3, simple app code and all the dependent code and files to public_html and created a link from my Resume/CV page for my app.

Thank you for looking at my 1XA3 Project02.
